# FireFront Boilerplate  
> Modern front-end boilerplate using many cool features and technologies to aid in the development.  

## Stack
- NodeJS
- GulpJS
- Stylus
- Kouto-Swiss
- Rupture
- Jeet
- Vendor prefixes
- Jade
- CSS, JS, HTML and Image minify
- CSS and JS concat
- Linter for JS
- Browser-Sync

## How to use
First, you'll need to install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) if you don't have it already,
then fork this repository, enter it and run:

```
npm install
```

Wait for the dependencies to install and enjoy a modern front-end workflow!!! xD

## Working with the boilerplate
You'll work only in the `src` directory. There you'll create all your `.jade`, `.styl`,
`.js` files and put your `images`.  

While you're developing just run:
```
gulp serve
```
This will create `.html`, `.css`, `.js` and copy `images` to the `app` directory and watch for
changes when you're developing your app.  

When you finish your app, just run:
```
gulp build
```
This will create minified `.html` and `image` files, a minified `main.css` file and a
concatenated and minified `main.js` file.

## Changelog
Check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/CodeShareEducation/firefront-boilerplate/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file!

## Sample Page
In the `src` directory there's a sample page using `.jade` and `.styl`! You can use it for a starting
point or you can delete it and create your own files!!! **BE FREE!**  

**I wish that this boilerplate can help you in your daily tasks!!!**
